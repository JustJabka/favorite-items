Favorite Items is a client-side mod that prevents you from accidentally dropping valuable items from your inventory.

# Usage
The mod adds a new keybinding called `Mark as Favorite` which is set to H by default. When you press it while hovering over an item in your inventory, it will mark that slot as a favorite.
If you are not in an inventory screen, it will mark the selected item in hotbar.

**The mod only prevents items from being dropped using the key bind, but you can still drop items manually.**
